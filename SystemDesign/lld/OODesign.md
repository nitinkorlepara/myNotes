# Object Oriented Analysis And Design

- Procedural Programming

  - Methods calling Methods

- OBject Oriented Programming

  - Objects Callign Objects
  - Object has Attributes and Methods

- Analysis is **WHY** we are doing the design which means all stake holder align same page.

- Use Case Diagram

  - Actors,Associations, System boundaries
  - Best Practices while drawing a UML Use-Case diagram are:

    - Proper Order of Use Cases is not necessary
    - Use the optimal amount of use cases & actors
    - If the Use-Case Diagram is too large, try to divide it into modules
    - Actors usually are nouns and Use-Cases usually start with Verbs
    - Each actor of the system should be associated with at least one use-case
    - Club multiple use-cases if possible, so as to reduce the complexity of the diagram
